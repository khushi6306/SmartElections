## ✨ Features

- **🔒 Biometric Verification**  
  Confirms voter identity to prevent fraud and unauthorized voting.

- **✅ Error Reduction**  
  Automates identity verification and vote recording to minimize human errors.

- **📊 Measurable Elections**  
  Allows accurate tracking, auditing, and reporting of election results with full transparency.

- **♿ Accessibility**  
  Provides an inclusive voting experience for people with disabilities and remote voters (NRIs/foreign residents).

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Authenticate** voters using biometric methods (fingerprint/facial recognition).
2. **Display** the candidate list for the authenticated voter.
3. **Record** the voter’s choice securely and confidentially.
4. **Audit** and **analyze** voting data while maintaining voter anonymity.
